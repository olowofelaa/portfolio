-am sorry that am submitting this project late sir, it is not that am not serious or am not interested. 
-In order to make some change for myself, I do video editing for people. So most times am on my laptop editing videos,  and this do take alot of my time, 
-That is what has been distracting lately.
-the project is a portfolio combined with a blog
-a user can go through the blog and make comments 
-The project is half way done
-am having problem with the static files, 
		I can’t load the js and css file (I have tired different method, but it not working)
		On the project portal, the img file isn’t uploading to the web.
These are the issue am having.
Doyin.
